  <body>

    servers = computers dedicated to hosting
<br> element is a set of tags
<p><b>different tags do <em>diff </em> stuff</b></p>

attributes are certain elements of tags. <br>
e.g anchor tag is used to link and href is element that names webpage
<br> image has attributes for source and text to display if source is no good
<br>
inline vs block elements
<p></p>
blocks create a container around the elements which auto creates a linebreak
<br>
different attributes will eventually allow for customization of the rectangle

div and span are inline and block elements to create a container
